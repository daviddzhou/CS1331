This is an update of my original review. I have the 38 V6 with
premium package and all available options. I've had the car for 9 mths
and it now has 13K miles of semi- aggressive highway and city
driving experience. I still love this car! And here's the best part,
since I've owned the car the only service required has been scheduled
maintenance. No rattles, no signs of wearing, and still fun to
drive. In the snow (we had an 18 in. snow storm last week), it handled
better than expected. I did struggle up a steep hill that wasn't
plowed well (4" of loose snow on road) but otherwise the car did
fine. I don't have any issues sports handling - but the ride could be
smoother. Buy this car!

I love the Lexicon sound system - and the tech package features. The
car is still whisper quiet and the handling is superb. The seats are
very comfortable for long drives and the zoned Heating and AC (front
and back) is outstanding. The luxury interior is outstanding in
appearance, fit, and finish. 

The 2010 model has some of the improvements including adaptive cruise
control, improved suspension, and touch screen Tech package. Would also
like bluetooth to import phone book, fold down back seat, and
blindspot alerts. None of these suggestions would stop me from buying
this car again. Go buy one!
