Well hey there my name is David Zhou and I am a first year here at Georgia Tech. My major is computer engineering but to be completely honest I'm thinking about switching to Industrial Engineering. A personal interest of mine is to research into how machine learning works and the ways to implement it into our daily lives especially as technology continues to progress at such a rapid rate.
