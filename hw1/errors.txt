Bad1.java

Bad1.java:8: error: reached end of file while parsing
    }

The error happens during compile time and it errors because there was not an ending curly brace

Bad2.java

Bad2.java:1: error: class BAD2 is public, should be declared in a file named BAD2.java
public class BAD2 {

The error happens during compile time and this is because the class is not named Bad2.java instead it is BAD2.

Bad3.java

This homework is due January Exception in thread "main" java.util.IllegalFormatConversionException: d != java.lang.String

Another error that I found was that the main problem originates from the fact that you are trying to take a string and output it as a decimal which makes the code very unhappy
